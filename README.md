# RL-Exploration-Paper-Lists

Paper Collection of Reinforcement Learning Exploration

Exploration Reinforcement Learning is an important topic in Reinforcement Learning research area, which is to essentially improve the sample efficiency in a MDP setting.

A simple form of exploration-exploitation dilemma can be seen from the Multi-Arm Bandit problems, and we do not include MAB papers for the different defination with RL, however many theoretical idea can be drived from MAB studies. 

Recently, most DRL exploration researches are focus on sparse reward settings and the target is a little different with the former studies, however we still classify those methods based on their methodology.

Papers are sorted by time and classification. Any suggestions and pull requests are welcome.

The sharing principle of these references here is for research. If any authors do not want their paper to be listed here, please feel free to contact me (Email: ericliuof97 [AT] gmail.com).
